# WatchtogetherClone

"WatchtogetherClone" is a project inspired by Watch2Gether. The project's essence lies in the ability to watch YouTube videos together with other users, with the option to control playback, pause, rewind, and all these actions happening simultaneously for everyone.
The project architecture follows a "client-server" model, where the client is a Vue-based application, and the server is built with Flask. Two-way communication between them is established using websockets through Socket.IO. To explore the server-side code, please visit the following GitHub page: [WatchtogetherCloneServer](https://github.com/JuanCote/WatchtogetherCloneServer).
